            <h2>Kobe Bean Bryant</h2>
            <p>Kobe Bryant was bron on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia. He was the youngest of three children and the only son of former
                NBA player Joe "JellyBean" Bryant. When Kobe was six years old, his family moved to Italy after his father retired from the NBA
                and continued his basketball career overseas. Growing up in Italy, Kobe quickly adapted to the culture, learning to speak Italian
                fluently and developing a love for soccer.
            </p>
            <p>Despite living abroad, he remained deeply connected to basketball, often playing against older kids and training hard to improve his skills. During summers, 
                he would return to the U.S. and play basketball leagues, which helped him stay competitive. Kobe's exposure to different styles of play, both in Europe and 
                America, shaped his versatile game. When his family moved back to the U.S., he attended Lower Merion High School near Philadelphia, where he became a basketball 
                sensation, leading his team to a state champioship and catching the attention of NBA scouts. At just 17, he declared for the NBA Draft, marking the beginning of 
                his legendary career.
